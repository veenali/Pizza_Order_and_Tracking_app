All the control routes go here. 
Instead of claming the logic inside the web.js folder we include it all in the controllers folder.

In all the 'controller.js' files we are writing a function. 
Later on that function is exported.
We use that function inside our respective controller files.
We call the function which returns an object(This is called as a factory function). 
This object has key-value pairs.
